E -> id = id * num


Explanation:
	w stands for while

	e stands for End
	E stands for expression

id: a|b|..|z
num: 0|1|..|9
Above two expansions are not considered for the grammar as well as for our main program to calculate Leading and Trailing sets,
as id and num are terminal symbols and can't be considered to be a part of the Left Hand Side of any production rule.
